234 T



Presenter: hello. Today's debate is on using animals for  work. The oldest domesticated animal is the dog. They protect our houses.look after us, and keep us safe.Other domesticate animals- used for food - include sheep,cows and goats,The first donkeys were used by humans approximately 6,000 years ago in Egypt.Horses were domesticated 5,000 years ago in Europe and Asia.All there animals have been used to help human being survive,either by providing food or by working for uw . horses , camels ,elephants - they have all helped humans explore their land and transport goods from one place to another . But is this fair? what about animals rights?To argue this issue with me today is Amy Johnson ,an animal rights activist and writer.To argue against the issue is Dr Jacob Kuryan.Dr Kuryan is a professor of Zoolofy and a writer of several books on animal welfare.You both have two minutes to introduce your point of view.Amy ,would you like to begin?

Amy: Thank you for inviting me to this debate.it's well known that animals have worked side-by side with humans for thousands of years. in fact, they helped us develop our civilisation and have helped humans survive. Animals, like elephants and horses, were used to build amazing structures, like the pyramids. Yet they hard work and suffering are hardly ever acknowledged. Horses, Camels and e;ephants were used to transport armies and soldiers during wars.But many of these animals died in there wars. And there are other examples. Even now ,dogs are used to pull sledges in cold climates and elephants are used for logging. There animals work long hours for very little reward. Humans just use them to theri advantage. My main argument is that,in the modern world,there in mo longer any need to use animals for work.We have technology that can replace then, It is simalar to useing children to woek in factories . Two hundred years ago, factory owners got rich by using animals to work for them,The problem is that the animals have no one to represent them and proptect their rights. Even though animals work hard for us ,they suffer.in short,I strongly believe that using animals for work is an old-fashioned and inhumane practice.



Dr Kuryan: thank you.It's true that animals have helped our cicilisation develop .Camels and horses helped us to carry goods across huge distances.Dog helped us hunt and protected us from wild animals. I want to argue that in many developing countries, poor people still need animals to survive. These are  people who can't afford cars, house alarms or expensive machines. Another point is that without humans , there domesticated animals would not have been able to survive. they need us and we look after them.Not all animal use us abuse.There ara mant pet owners and animal lovers around the world who work in animal shelters and help animals.There are laws that stop animals suffering.Here's am interesting point - in modern cities, we don't see animals suffering . On the contrary,developed countries spend a lot of money every year on pet food, pet toys, and health care.We even have pet spas where our furry friends can get a massage and frist-class treatment for a day.At the same time, there are still millions of children in the world who don't get this kind of treatment.They go without food or clothing.I strongly believe that , in a modern society, people often care more for animals than the poor.

Presenter: Thank you both of you for your arguments! Now, let's hear from our listeners...It's often said that it's cruel to use animals for entertainment.However,I would like to argue against this idea.I know that many animal lovers would disagree with me ,but let me explain my point  of view.First of all,keeping animals in zoos helps protect them.For example,many species such as the giant panda or the snow leopard are enddangered.Yet,they are safer in zoos.Another point is that zoos have an important educational role.When I was a child ,my father took me to the zoo.I learned about exotic animals and I also learned to care about animals.Modern zoos have improved theri conditions.Animals are no longer kept in small cages,zoos have large areas where animals can feel as if they are in their natural habitat.To summarize the main points,zoos help protect animals and educate us.Finally,modern zoos are comfortable,safe places for wild animals.In conclusion, I believe that we should help zoos by visiting , or donating money.
